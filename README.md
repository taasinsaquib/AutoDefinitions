# AutoDefinitions
Scrape definitions, usage, and part of speech for words

While studying for the GRE, I compiled a list of words whose definitions I needed to learn. After realizing that manually looking up a few hundred definitions would be tedious and easily automated, I got to work. I put together a simple dictionary.com scraper that outputs the information I need to a text file.
